# 💖 Valentine's Day Web Project

I just had to create one of these, It was so fun!

A fun, interactive web app with a **glassmorphism** aesthetic, designed to send a personalized valentine question to someone special. The app includes smooth animations, a growing 'Yes' button, and a playful 'No' button trick.

## 🎯 Features
✅ **Glassmorphism UI** with blur effects and smooth animations  
✅ **Interactive buttons** that resize dynamically  
✅ **3D effects** for a visually immersive experience  
✅ **Personalized message** with a typewriter effect  
✅ **Mobile-friendly & responsive design**

### **2️⃣ How to Customize Your Partner's Name**
By default, the app displays the name `JILLIAN`. You can change it in `main.js`:

#### **Steps to edit:**
1. Open `main.js` in a text editor.
2. Find the following line:
   ```js
   let partnerName = "JILLIAN"; // Replace with your partner's name
   ```
3. Change `JILLIAN` to your partner’s name, like this:
   ```js
   let partnerName = "ALEX";
   ```
4. Save the file and refresh the page to see the update.
